Project 2 - Instanews

Summary:

For our second project, we learned how to build a webpage using our current HTML & CSS skills, and incorporated Ajax, JSON, and API concepts. We used an API to extract specific information from an url, and display the info via a grid-based layout. The user is able to select a category in the drop down menu, and visit a news story of their choosing. 

Technologies used:   
‣HTML
‣CSS/SASS 
‣JavaScript
‣jQuery
‣Ajax/JSON
‣Git/Github

Personal Learnings/Issues:

I learned a lot about JavaScript and jQuery while building Instanews. I had a lot of trouble in the beginning with JS, but began to grasp the concept more at the end. I figured out how to apply a transition by using "transform" and "transition", giving the text over-top of the grid-based images a nifty little effect when hovered over it when the mouse. I also learned how to use CSS grid a little more, and attempted to use it instead of flexbox for this project.
